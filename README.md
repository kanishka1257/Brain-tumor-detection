# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

This project aims to classify brain MRI images for tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It helps in identifying four types of cases: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **No Tumor**, improving speed and accuracy in medical diagnoses.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess MRI image data
- Augment data using zoom techniques
- Build and train a CNN model
- Evaluate model performance
- Predict tumor type from new MRI images
- Save and export the trained model

## Dataset
Dataset sourced from Kaggle with **7023 MRI images**, divided as:

### Training Set:
- Glioma: 1321 images  
- Meningioma: 1349 images  
- Pituitary: 1457 images  
- No Tumor: 1605 images  

### Testing Set:
- Glioma: 300 images  
- Meningioma: 306 images  
- Pituitary: 300 images  
- No Tumor: 405 images  

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## Results
Model trained and evaluated using Google Colab, achieving high accuracy in classifying brain tumors. The final model can be used to analyze new MRI images.
